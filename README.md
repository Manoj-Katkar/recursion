Recursion = 
        Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. The function breaks down a complex problem into smaller sub-problems, and keeps calling itself with the smaller sub-problem until it reaches a base case, which can be solved without recursion, and then it returns the solution to the sub-problems back up the chain of function calls.
